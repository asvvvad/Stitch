# Stitch: Truely _micro_ PHP framework to write less and enjoy more

Stitch is truely **micro** and **modular** PHP framework that wraps FastRoute, Plates, and Medoo.

It was made to:
- Write less code.
- Build small but modern websites and apps that can be hosted anywhere PHP is accepted.
- Prototype APIs and websites very fast.
- Enjoy routing and templating without the hasstle of having to use a big framework nor stitching up libraries to make things work.

## Getting started:
You can get started by seeing the [documentation]() and downloading one of the two [templates](#templates).
